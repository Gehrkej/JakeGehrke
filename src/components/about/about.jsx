                        <p>I am a recent graduate of Oregon State University, holding a degree in Computer Science with
                            a minor in General Business. My academic journey culminated with a GPA of 3.81 and earn me
                            greek honors of magna cum laude.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my studies, I engaged in a variety of impactful projects. For my senior capstone,
                            I collaborated with the OSU Men's golf team to develop a custom training app. We protoyped
                            the application with Figma, developed the front end in React
                            Native, and took a serverless approach by using Google Firebase. Additionally, I created a
                            responsive weather web
                            application with React and Emotion for the front end and enabled real-time data by
                            integrating the OpenWeather API. I
                            also led the development of "Fight the Night," a 2D action-platformer, showcasing my skills
                            in Unity and C#.</p>

                        <p>Professionally, I served as the Website and Media Development Coordinator for the Associated
                            Students of Oregon State University (ASOSU). In this role, I enhanced the websiteâ€™s design
                            and functionality, led the migration to Drupal 10, and designed marketing materials that
                            significantly increased student engagement. Previously, I worked as a Student Technician at
                            OSU's MIME IT, providing technical support and managing work through a ticketing system.</p>

                        <p>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have demonstrated leadership as President of
                            the Oregon State University Club Baseball team, where I managed internal affairs and
                            coordinated with external entities to plan a 19-game season. Some noteworthy events and
                            projects from this were ending 3rd at regional with a final national ranking of 19 out 500
                            teams, fundraising over $2000 each season, and investing in long term assets for the club
                            such as a pitching machine and new jerseys. </p>

                        <p>Reflecting on my past experience, I look to bring my dedication, hard work, and passion into
                            my professional career.</p>
